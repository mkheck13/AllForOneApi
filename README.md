# All For One API

**Description:** Design an API that has ten endpoints. Each endpoint has their own Controller file in the Controller folder. Each endpoint has their own Services file in the Service folder. The endpoints are as followed:

[x]1. SayHello: Create an API Endpoint that takes in the users input and outputs a greeting containing the users input.

[x]2. Asking Questions: endpoint that accepts 2 inputs. You will take the answer from those inputs and display the answer in one sentence.
     - What is your name? 
     - What time did you wake up?
     *Your output should be a sentence that tells me who the person is and what time they woke up

[x]3. Add Two Numbers: endpoint that accepts 2 numbers.  Once you have the numbers, add them together and print out the results in a sentence.
     - Example results, "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4."

[x]4. MadLib: create an endpoint that accepts multiple inputs.  Output should be a story based on those values.

[x]5. OddOrEven: create an endpoint that displays if a number entered is odd or even.

[x]6. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters then reverses them.

[x]7. ReverseIt (Numbers Only): endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and reverses them.  Be sure to display the original characters before the reversed.

[x]8. Magic 8 Ball: create a endpoint generates 8 unique responses. One controller


[]9. Guess It: create 3 endpoints (one controller) that takes an input, then outputs if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed.
Easy Mode 1-10
Medium Mode 1-50
Hard Mode 1-100

[]10. Restaurant Picker: create 1 endpoint that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant based on the category chosen. 10 Restaurants per category.
